# GitHub Scripts

This repo is a collection of scripts that use a [personal access token][token]
and [octokit][] to interact with the GitHub API. It started as a way to fill out
an allocations spreadsheet at work, but then I kept bumping into situations
where I wanted to script something about interacting with GitHub. I hate
repeating this stuff, so I decided to save these things here in this repo.
